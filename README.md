## Microsoft Moves into Movie Streaming


### Problem Statement

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team has free range

Therefore your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

### In This Repo

The **Data** folder has all the data sets we used and some we didn't.
All of these sets were downloaded from their respective host sites on June 14, 2019.

Cleaning and analysis was conducted in the jupyter notebook, **Microsoft-streaming-analysis-technical-2.ipynb**.
This is a technical (but hopefully not terse) notebook in which the reader can follow along by re-running each cell.

The results of our analysis were presented as a powerpoint, which is now saved as a pdf under **"TFS Project 1_ Microsoft Movie Streaming Analysis.pdf"**
