# Movie Performance Analysis
## Microsoft Moves into Movie Streaming


### Problem Statement

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team has free range

Therefore your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

 ### Project Members: Misha Berrin and Clifford Bridges
 
 ### Goals
- [x] Use data from at least two sources
    - [ ] Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
    - [x] Clean dataset & record parameters used to clean the data
        You may use Pandas or Python functions
        Document every step of the cleaning process
    - [x] Create at least two new features that were not present in the original data sets

- [ ] Use Pandas and Numpy to generate useful metrics for comparing films

   A Jupyter notebook targeted to a technical audience that contains
   - [ ] Clean and commented code so an independent party can replicate your analysis and justify your analytical choices
   - [ ] Code should follow Pep8 standards
   - [ ] Custom functions should be stored in .py file and imported whenever possible
   - [ ] Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
   - [ ] Cool Summary Tables

### In This Repo

The **Data** folder has all the data sets we used and some we didn't. 
All of these sets were downloaded from their respective host sites on June 14, 2019.

Cleaning and analysis was conducted in the jupyter notebook, **Microsoft-streaming-analysis-technical-2.ipynb**.
This is a technical (but hopefully not terse) notebook in which the reader can follow along by re-running each cell.

The results of our analysis were presented as a powerpoint, which is now saved as a pdf under **"TFS Project 1_ Microsoft Movie Streaming Analysis.pdf"**
